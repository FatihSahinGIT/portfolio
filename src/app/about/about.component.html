                I am Fatih Sahin, a 25-year-old frontend developer based in
                Berlin, Germany. I specialize in building modern, responsive web
                applications with a strong focus on usability, performance, and
                thoughtful design
            </p>

            <p class="about-introduction__text-content text-base md:w-3/4">
                My fascination with frontend development comes from its role as
                the bridge between design and code — the place where ideas
                become real, interactive experiences. I care deeply about
                accessibility and aim to create interfaces that are intuitive,
                inclusive, and feel naturally “right” to use.
            </p>

            <p class="about-introduction__text-content text-base md:w-3/4">
                Curious by nature and motivated by continue learning, I
                regularly explore new tools, frameworks, and techniques to
                expand my skill set and stay up to date with modern web
                development practices. I approach every project with a
                solution-oriented mindset, aiming to deliver outcomes that are
                both innovative and practical.

                I participated in an accessibility workshop led by Dr. Maria
                Korneeva. The course addressed web accessibility standards
                including WCAG and focused on integration into Angular
                applications. <br />
                Key topics included designing accessible components, applying
                the appropriate use of ARIA , ensuring keyboard navigation and
                focus management, structuring semantic HTML to support assistive
                technologies, providing accessible forms and error messaging,
                and managing color contrast and responsive layout for inclusive
                experiences. The training also covered how to audit and test
                Angular applications for accessibility issues and embed
                accessibility practices into the development workflow.

                I completed a comprehensive Angular training covering the
                fundamentals and advanced concepts of Angular, including
                component architecture, services, dependency injection, routing,
                forms, and application structure. The course included practical
                work with TypeScript, Angular CLI, Standalone Components,
                Signals, and reactive programming with RxJS. <br />
                Additional topics included HTTP communication with REST APIs,
                state handling, testing practices, and best-practice
                architectural patterns for building scalable and maintainable
                Angular applications.

            As a detail-oriented developer, I focus on the small but impactful
            aspects of UI development: spacing, element placement, smooth state
            transitions, and micro-interactions. I believe great frontend work
            lies in these details—when thoughtfully implemented, they create
            interfaces that feel seamless and intuitive. <br /><br />
            I strive to make design ideas shine through clean, performant, and
            maintainable code. Collaborating deeply with designers allows me to
            better understand the intention behind every pixel and transform it
            into meaningful user experiences.
