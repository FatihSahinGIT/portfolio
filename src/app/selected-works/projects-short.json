            "introduction": "kv.digital GmbH is the innovation and competence center for the digitalization of outpatient medical care (“niedergelassene ärztliche Versorgung”) in Germany. It is a 100% subsidiary of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV). The company develops and operates digital platforms, web and app solutions that support secure medical communication (for example, the exchange of doctor’s letters, lab data, and patient-related messages) and patient services such as appointment booking via the “116117 Terminservice” or vaccination appointment services.",
            "role": "In my position as Frontend Developer at kv.digital, I was responsible for building user interfaces across multiple target groups, with a special focus on patients and call center employees. For patients, this meant designing and implementing the interfaces through which they can search for doctors, book appointments (e.g. via the 116117-platforms), and manage vaccination appointments. For call center staff, I developed internal tools that enable them to manage, update, and coordinate appointments efficiently, ultimately supporting patients and practices more effectively. I worked closely with UX/UI designers, backend teams, and product managers to ensure the frontend was not only functional but also accessible, intuitive, and aligned with the overall product vision.",
            "technology": "The technology stack I worked with was centered around Angular and Angular Material for building modular and scalable user interfaces, paired with TypeScript to maintain strong typing and robust code quality. For quality assurance, I regularly used Jest for testing and SonarQube to monitor and maintain code health, while Jenkins and Nexus Deployment were essential for our CI/CD pipelines. Collaboration across teams was streamlined through tools like Jira and Confluence, version control was handled via Bitbucket, and Storybook and Figma played a crucial role in aligning design and development workflows, ensuring consistency across our components and applications.",
            "challenges": "One of the biggest challenges of my work was developing within a monorepo that supplies software to multiple platforms used by different user groups. This required careful consideration of module separation, dependency management, and build configurations to ensure reusability without unnecessary coupling. Another important aspect was accessibility: since many of our products are patient-facing, it was crucial to make them usable for people with disabilities and across various devices and browsers. Maintaining a high level of code quality was an ongoing effort, involving regular refactoring, enforcing architectural standards, writing thorough tests, and using tools like SonarQube to monitor technical debt. Furthermore, ensuring smooth maintenance and updates across multiple applications — which often needed to comply with regulatory requirements — was essential to keeping our software reliable and user-friendly.",
            "takeaway": "Working at kv.digital has been a meaningful experience for me, as the products I help build have a real and positive impact on German healthcare. I am particularly motivated by the fact that my work directly supports patients in getting timely appointments and assists call center employees in providing better service. This experience has deepened my appreciation for accessible and user-centric design and strengthened my ability to deliver seamless, efficient user experiences. I have also learned how to work effectively with large, shared codebases and how to collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that serves a greater purpose."
